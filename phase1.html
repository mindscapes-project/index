        Mindscapes started with a pilot data collection carried out through the Covid lockdowns and across moments when restricitons were eased. We used a Muse EEG portable and non-invasive headset and asked people from a variety of occupational areas to wear it while performing a choice activities to include a work-related/productive activity, a leaisure activity and a moment of physically inactive mental relaxation/pure thinking/daydreaming. After recording the brainwave signals, people were also asked to recollect their experience and recount it in words, so to enable connections between the two and identifying soft information to later inform the visualisation of the data.
        
        Due to Covid taking the global scene right at the start of our project, some of our intentions, collection methods and interests had to be readapted (eg to comply with health and safety and covid regulations) or reframed. The range of the initial group of participants was tailored to sample the professional and social roles that felt more representative of this historical moment (the NHS/key worker, the worker from home, the  mumâ€¦), as well as covering a range between screen-based, creative and physical labour works. 
        
        Our initial intention was to consider data from urban informatics that may address the divide between productive work activities and activities that engage the visual mind in a non-utilitarian way (leisure, culture, sleep and more), with attention to the different patterns across diverse groups and the consequent impact on wellbeing. Once again because of the pandemic, it became relevant to include where and when the recorded activities happened wihtin the home or in a workplace, outdoors and in green areas or indoors. Acknowledging the new factors brought about by the pandemic, we hope to expand to comment on the relevance of imaginative moments as a coping method to the situation.
