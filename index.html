      MINDSCAPES is a collaborative project by drawing and installation artist Maria Teresa Ortoleva and computer scientist and data visualization expert Dr. Rita Borgo, Head of the Human Centred Computing (HCC) research group and Champion of the Urban Living Hub in the Department of Informatics at King’s College London. Mindscapes engages with research in data visualisation, urban informatics and mental wellbeing, exploring the potential of using the art languages of sculpture and installation to translate urban data into three-dimensional space, creating immersive and empathic environments.

      The project deepens Ortoleva’s ongoing interest in EEG records of brainwaves that occur during elusive moments of our imaginative consciousness: from fancy to remembrance, hypnagogia and dream, and intersects Dr. Borgo’s research on …(...add…)
      Working together they aim at… ...research in data spatialisation and how visualising the mind through material/experientiable objects that inhabit the space of our perception/body can widen the understanding and empower with further awareness of mental wellbeing.

      <div class="fade"><h1>Phase 1</h1></div>
      <img class="fade" src="images/image1.jpg">
      <div class="fade">
        Mindscapes started with a pilot data collection carried out through the Covid lockdowns and across moments when restricitons were eased. We used a Muse EEG portable and non-invasive headset and asked people from a variety of occupational areas to wear it while performing a choice activities to include a work-related/productive activity, a leaisure activity and a moment of physically inactive mental relaxation/pure thinking/daydreaming. After recording the brainwave signals, people were also asked to recollect their experience and recount it in words, so to enable connections between the two and identifying soft information to later inform the visualisation of the data.
        
        Due to Covid taking the global scene right at the start of our project, some of our intentions, collection methods and interests had to be readapted (eg to comply with health and safety and covid regulations) or reframed. The range of the initial group of participants was tailored to sample the professional and social roles that felt more representative of this historical moment (the NHS/key worker, the worker from home, the  mum…), as well as covering a range between screen-based, creative and physical labour works. 
        
        Our initial intention was to consider data from urban informatics that may address the divide between productive work activities and activities that engage the visual mind in a non-utilitarian way (leisure, culture, sleep and more), with attention to the different patterns across diverse groups and the consequent impact on wellbeing. Once again because of the pandemic, it became relevant to include where and when the recorded activities happened wihtin the home or in a workplace, outdoors and in green areas or indoors. Acknowledging the new factors brought about by the pandemic, we hope to expand to comment on the relevance of imaginative moments as a coping method to the situation.

      <img class="fade" src="images/image2.jpg">
      <div class="fade">
        Starting from her experience working with laser cut fluorescent, reflective and transparent acrylic glass, Maria Teresa Ortoleva will work towards transforming the graphic representation of complex multidimensional and multivariate spectral data into sculptural objects of coded colours, textures and surface qualities that aim at operating perceptually, symbolically and empathically to convey the content of the analysis in an accurate and yet accessible and eloquent way. The same method will inform choices in placing the produced sculptural renditions of data in space: their heights, distances and layout, and how they engage with viewers.
        The expected result will be an immersive and sensorial visualisation of a collective mindscape showing the ratio between conscious productive activity and moments of speculative thinking and imagination in urban lifestyles, and pointing at the importance of this balance to health and wellbeing.

      <div class="fade">
        MARIA TERESA ORTOLEVA is a London-based artist and currently a King’s Artist in Residence in the department of Informatics at King’s College London. She graduated with a MA from the Slade School of Fine Art in 2014 and since then she has been working in the UK and in Italy, where she is represented by the gallery Luca Tommasi. Her work moves between interdisciplinary research, diagrammatic drawing, the sculpturisation/spatialisation of data, site responsive installations, education and community projects. Traversing these different areas, she explores phenomena of mental imagery and experiments with creating a language to make sense of the workings of imagination and reveal its value in cognition and mental wellbeing. Selected exhibitions of her work include: JGM Gallery (London, 2021), Bocconi Art Gallery (Milan 2020), Luca Tommasi (Milan, 2019; solo 2018), Palazzo Reale (Milan, 2017), Galleria San Fedele (Milan, 2017), Fondazione Arnaldo Pomodoro (solo, Milan, 2016), ExpoMilano2015, Wysing Arts Centre (Cambridge, 2013), Arcade (London, 2013). Other public presentations and engagement projects include: University of Milan Bicocca (2016), Drawing Room (London, 2015), Wysing Arts Centre (Cambridge, 2014-2015). Her work has received recognition and support from: King’s College London (2019), European Regional Development Fund (London Creative Network, Space, 2019), Ventura Projects Special Award (2018), Premio Cairo (finalist 2017), Premio San Fedele (finalist 2017), Leverhulme Trust (Wysing Arts Centre, 2013), Gay Clifford Award (UCL, 2012).
